  <div class="card-body text-justify" style="background-color: #daeff1; ">The Uttarakhand Health Systems Development Project (UKHSDP) is a project intended to be implemented over a period of six years, beginning with its approval by the World Bank in 2017 and ending with an expected completion date of September 2023.[17] The UKHSDP was issued through the International Development Association (IDA) in conjunction with the Department of Medical Health and Family Welfare of the government of Uttarakhand.[18] The goal of the project is to "support Uttarakhand in improving the access to and quality of health services, and providing health financial risk protection"[19] and the project has a total project cost of USD$125 million, USD$100 million of which was awarded by the World Bank. The remaining USD$25 million was funded by the local government.[17]

The need for the project stems from unequal access to quality health care, which is impeded by the size and distribution of settlements paired with the region's topography. The Uttarakhand region is a very hilly, mountainous region that sees a population spread out between major cities with a density of more than 500 people per square kilometer to rural areas with less than 50 people per square kilometer.[18] The UKHSDP notes that there is a deep employment asymmetry among its most rural areas with 48% vacancies in its listings for medical officers and 75% vacancies for medical specialists.[18]

The project has two component areas: innovations in the private sector and stewardship and system improvement. The first component focuses on a logistical fix to the current healthcare system and builds off a previously completed IDA project from 2008. The goal is to hire outside contractors in multiple areas to help with contract management and other system-wide logistical support positions. The system as a whole would improve the supply chain, multi-sectoral communication, data management, and information systems implementation. The second component address the direct action part of their original issue of getting health professionals to rural areas and has three subcategories: mobile specialty units, integration of Public-Private partnership (PPP) centers, and expanding the RSBY health coverage to adolescent primary care and care for the poor affected with Noncommunicable diseases (NCD's).[18]

As of October 1, 2019 the project's Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Overall Implementation Progress (IP) has been moderately satisfactory, an improvement from its prior rating of moderately unsatisfactory.[20]
